# Conditions

This language cover a various number of operators returning boolean values

- `a < b` less than
- `a <= b` less than or equal to
- `a > b` greater thanÃ©
- `a >= `greater than or equal to b
- `a == b` equal to
- `a != b` not equal to

Their use is pretty straight forward, you can get the boolean value and store it as a variable or use it in **if statements**

```
var value = 1 == 2;
// value == false
```

As we said earlier, they can be use in **if statements**, check out next page...
