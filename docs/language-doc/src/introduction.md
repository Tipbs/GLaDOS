# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for GLaDOS, a custom language created in Haskell that allows users to write programs in the kope syntax.

GLaDOS simplifies the process of creating and running programs by seamlessly translating kope-syntax-coded programs into WebAssembly, an industry-standard binary instruction format. This allows for cross-platform compatibility and efficient execution of code.
